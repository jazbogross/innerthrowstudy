This is a python project that should load the following video and audio files and use a python script to trigger them to play in a looping fashion. The video and audio files are separate but have the same naming convention, so that for example kick.mov corresponds to kick.wav. The reason for this is that I want to be able to trigger the video and audio to play in a loop together but then the video that is playing should be able to change while the audio keeps looping. The python should be in root while the video and audio files should be found in a folder called HD. The HD folder should be gitignored.
